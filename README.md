latest CV with a read me file as a cover note
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am a Computer Science student who is just finishing my first year BSc through the Open University in Computing and IT. I am looking for employment within this sector, such as web development, junior programming engineer, data management. I am highly motivated and passionate about coding. I am proficient in Python, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. A lot of this has been done through self study outside of my degree. I am confident that my passion for programming, my technical skills and my eagerness to learn, would make me a valuable asset to your organisation.
Whilst I have a strong understanding of programming concepts, my background is in Engineering. I have many transferrable skills, I can work in a fast paced environment, and thrive under pressure, especially when presented with new challenges. Much of my work within Engineering required strong problem solving skills and an ability to to develop and implement innovative solutions.
I am eager to continue my learning and expanding my skillset within this field. I am honestly just looking for an opportunity, and given a chance, I know that I have the enthusiasm and drive to be an asset to your team.
Thank you for taking the time to read this application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further with you
Sincerely
Steve Hough
